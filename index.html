            GreenEDP is a living laboratory where undergraduate, graduate, and professional students engage with staff and faculty to pilot new eco-driven solar technologies and policies for the Emergent Digital Practices program at the University of Denver. GreenEDP hopes to help the University of Denver become a leader in sustainability and build on its reputation as a progressive, forward thinking institution.
            My <a href="http://greenedp.org/collaborators/" target="_blank">collaborators</a> and I worked on this project throughout the last half of the Spring 2015 quarter at the University of Denver. I was in charge of managing some of the content for the web-page, including taking and editing the headshots of the collaborators and designing the logo on the left.

            Designed in Spring 2013 as a visually interactive mapping resource, GEARS aims to increase bike commuting in the Denver Metro area. GEARS was created with three specific goals in mind; to increase commuter ridership and sustainable practices, promote health, and decrease the University of Denverâ€™s carbon footprint for our community and the world. We recruited volunteer riders who commuted to DU via bike to wear special action-cameras which recorded
            footage of their route, while tracking their GPS coordinates. You can find examples of what his looks like <a href="http://denvergears.com/choose-your-path/" target="_blank">here</a>. During this project, I was part of the Design team. I helped with web-page layouts, as well as designing the logo you see on the right. I also collected some of the photography used on the site.

            This is a short piece I created demonstrating the possibility of a cigarette butt that can biodegrade without leeching harmful chemicals into the environment. The goal of the project was to create a video piece that demonstrated a possible cradle to cradle scenario for an everyday object. We were required to use both original and attributed footage in this project. I shot the original footage with my DSLR camera
            and edited it with Final Cut Pro.

            For this project I wanted to explore things that were familiar and interesting to me. I love taking photographs, especially of landscapes. However, I wanted to show different kinds of landscapes. This short video piece focuses on the juxtaposition of urban versus natural landscapes. I filmed in locations that best exemplified these types of landscapes, All while keeping a photograph approach to shooting.
            As for the cinematic aspect of the piece, I wanted to get footage that was not only visually interesting in its content, but in its process as well. I used pans, tilts, and pull-focus shots to enhance transitions. The piece was created for a project during a class on Time-based media, and required a dichotomy be made through the content of the video.
